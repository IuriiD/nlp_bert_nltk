    <br>
    <p>
        <i>"TL;DR" ("Too Long; Didn't read")</i> project is a website which allows a user to paste an arbitrary text and:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            get it summarized to a given number of sentences or
        </li>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Text is summarized following extractive summarization approach using Natural Language Toolkit (<a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a>; adapted from [<a href="https://medium.com/luisfredgs/automatic-text-summarization-with-machine-learning-an-overview-68ded5717a25">1</a>]) and question answering is implemented using a pre-trained machine learning model <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)">BERT</a>, fine-tuned on the <a href="https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD</a> benchmark (adapted from [<a href="https://mccormickml.com/2020/03/10/question-answering-with-a-fine-tuned-BERT/">2</a>]).

        I created this app as my <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/project/">final project</a> in the <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/">CS50</a> course and as my first acquiaintance with BERT and NTLK.
